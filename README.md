# GoogeDotTeller

dotnet core version of https://github.com/berthubert/googerteller

[![Build application](https://github.com/cyclops1982/GoogeDotTeller/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/cyclops1982/GoogeDotTeller/actions/workflows/build.yaml)

## Notes:

1. You'll need to use `git clone --recursive` as we are using the SharpPcap as a submodule.
2. You'll need a support pcap library, for windows that's [npcap](https://npcap.com/#download)
3. We're using [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio) to play sound.
